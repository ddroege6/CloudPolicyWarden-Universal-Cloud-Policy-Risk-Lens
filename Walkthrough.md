### Before/After Risk Score Comparison
*[Screenshot: before-after-risk-scores.png]*

**Layout:**
```
BEFORE                    |  AFTER
======================== |  ========================
üî¥ RISK SCORE: CRITICAL  |  üü¢ RISK SCORE: LOW
                         |
- s3:* permissions       |  - s3:GetObject only
- No resource limits     |  - Specific bucket ARNs
- Missing conditions     |  - Encryption required
- Privilege escalation   |  - No escalation paths
```

### Policy Code Comparison
